## Project Overview

### What I Do

1. **Project Setup and Architecture**
2. **Tailwind CSS Configuration**
   - Set up and configured Tailwind CSS for styling.
3. **Store Configuration with Pinia**
4. **ESLint and Prettier Configuration**
5. **Husky Integration**
   - Configured Husky with a pre-commit hook to ensure code quality.
6. **API Integration**
   - Integrated functionality with a public API (create, delete, and edit requests are operational, but data is not saved in the database).
7. **Light-Dark Mode Integration**
   - Implemented light-dark mode based on `prefers-color-scheme`.

### Future Enhancements

#### What I Want to do but not do

1. **More Reusable Components**
   - Develop a components more reusable (requires design system).
2. **Automated Testing**
   - Integrate end-to-end (E2E) or unit tests using Cypress or Jest (requires more time).
3. **Component Prefix Plugin**
   - Create a plugin to automatically add a prefix to components (e.g., `ui/input` -> `<UiInput />`) (requires more time).
4. **Drag and Drop on mobile version**
   - Implement a drag and drop on mobile version (requires more time).
5. **Loading Directive**
   - Implement a loading directive for usage like `v-loading="loading"` (requires more time).

#### Spended time

**I spent about 14-16 hours on all the integrations**
